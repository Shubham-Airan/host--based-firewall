# host--based-firewall


Design:

I have created Rules class for individual Rules present in each line of our CSV file.
It has all attribues as given by each firewall rule from our CSV file.

I have created arraylist of Rules so that all Rules object are added line by line from CSV file to this arraylist.











Attributions:
I took reference from below link to check whether a IPaddress is in given range or not.
